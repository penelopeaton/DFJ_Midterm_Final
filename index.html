  Throughout The New School there are multiple locations where you can view art collections gathered by our own New School curators, Silvia Rocciolo and Eric Starke. There is a plethora of different forms of art distributed in our own University Center and 12th Street building. The curators work to demonstrate specific artists and historical pieces in order to further the art community entirely. </p> <p>The New School has gathered over eight different mediums of work over the years, starting in the early 1960’s, where we first received a grant from Albert A. List and his wife Vera. Albert and Vera’s mission originally was to highlight important social and political issues through art. Together they helped grow the collection to over 2,000 postwar and contemporary works of art. These original and new pieces are distributed throughout campus in order to inspire, motivate and provide historical awareness.</p> <p>The New School has collected art through donation and purchases over the years some which include work by artists such as Sol LeWitt, Dave Muller, Martin Puryear, Brian Tolle, and Kara Walker. And three recent site-specific commissions by Frank Stella, Alfredo Jaar, Glenn Ligon, and Rita McBride have been installed in the University Center at 63 Fifth Avenue. Below are a few notable numbers of types of art the New School has: </p>

The New School publicly displays certain exhibits throughout campus that are constantly being updated yearly. Along with these exhibits, there are also permanent site-specific pieces made for The New School. The New School has landed sites spread out across 12th Street, The University Center and also West 13th. These art works have been commissioned by The New School social researchers and the new school art collectors. </p> <p>The New School started their site specific collection in the 1930s in order to display new art in public spaces, once again wanting to interlock aesthetic, urbanism, design and even art expressing political issues. The New School has been collecting these pieces for over 100 years, even sending one of the very first murals it received in 1984 from artist, Thomas Hart Benton to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2012. These site-specific collections are still growing today; within the past few weeks we have accumulated a mural by Agnes Denes located in the University Center Cafeteria. </p>

  Head curator Silvia Rocciolo announced that there are multiple historic and specific pieces made for The New School that many students don't know about since there is no documentation on the art collection information. In 2019, The New School will release a short book informing the public on the history of the school’s works of art as well as what artists we feature on campus.</p> <p> Professor Lydia Matthews, director of the curatorial design research lab and visual culture, briefly touched on the creation of the upcoming release of the book and the research project behind it. Matthews explained that the book will be a platform for students to find out who these artists are and why we wanted these specific pieces to be part of our university. According to Matthews the book will unveil the values of what The New School thinks is the most important art work at the moment.</p><p> It will show that the art commissioned is all contemporary at the time received, showing the progression of each collection. Each piece is reflective of the historical and political issues in the time received. For example, we own a collection of LIFE magazines organized and styled by artist Alfredo Jaar. This piece explores how politics are represented in mainstream media and how it is integrated into our own assumptions about culture and ethnicity. This piece is called, “Searching for Africa in LIFE” which we received from Jaar in 2014.</p> <p> This piece was put into The New School's specific site pieces, where it is on display year-round. This is said to be one of Matthews’ favorite pieces because throughout the installation the viewer is able to think about how Africa was either made invisible previously through LIFE magazine or how it was made into a stereotype. The viewer is able to see the progression of time through the covers, showing how African-Americans appeared once through media stories that are either eagerly told, ignored, elevated or devalued. You can find this installation located in the library on 63 Fifth Ave. Matthews also informed us that The New School specifically picks out an artist they want to pursue, and then in return, the artist puts together a proposal for what he or she wants to create particularly for The New School.
